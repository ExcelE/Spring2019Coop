# Assignment for Week 1 (CCNY Coop)

## Description:
This is an assignment for practicing basic programming and code interfacing. Focus is on learning git, IDEs and terminal.


## Questions for this week (For Professors):
```
1. describe your favorite editor and explain two outstanding reasons why it is in your favor.
```
**For IDE:** VS Code due to its extension library and community support.  
**For terminal editing:** Nano due to its integrated shortcuts while editing. Was exposed to vim later and found unintuitive as a beginner 

```
2. write a shell script to change the names of all .txt files based on the number of lines:
   a) remove all empty files;
   b) less than 10: prefix the name by short_;
   c) between 10 and 20 (inclusive): prefix the name by medium_;
   d) more than 20: prefix the name by long_;
   submit your code and screen shots/captures before and after running the script
```
On the `file_rename.sh`, I essentially loop through the filenames that end with .txt. I check the number of lines  
of each files and if they fit the criteria, they'll be renamed according to the requirements above.
   
```
3. create a repo on github/gitlab/bitbucket and add/revise/branch/merge files, submit your repo address so your actions can be checked.

put all your files in the folder coop_asmt1 of your repo and just send me the link to your git repo, put more implementation details in the readme of your repo.
```
